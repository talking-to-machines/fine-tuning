The primary aim of this intervention was to take vaccine doses and nurses to administer vaccines to remote, rural communities. The initiative involved the following steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1. On the first day of the intervention, a social mobilization team—trained and supervised by the MoHS—organized a conversation with all village leaders, including the town chief, mammy queen, town elders, the youth leaders and religious leaders, and any other important stakeholders including the paramount and section chiefs if they were available. The mobilization team explained the purpose of the visit, answered questions about the available vaccines and asked leaders for their cooperation in encouraging eligible community members to take the COVID-19 vaccine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2. Social mobilizers then asked leaders to convene a community meeting that same evening (when people return home from farms) to allow mobilizers to talk directly with all village residents about vaccine efficacy and safety, the importance of getting vaccinated, and to address villagers’ questions and concerns. This process ended with social mobilizers explaining the location and timing of the mobile vaccination site that they were about to set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3. Vaccine doses, nurses to administer vaccines and MoHS staff who could register the vaccinated were brought into the community either the same evening or early the next morning. The vaccine doses and staff often travelled on motorbikes or on boats given the difficult terrain they had to traverse to reach these remote communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4. Once the team was in place, the temporary vaccination site started operating in a central location in the village. The vaccination site remained operational from sunrise to sunset over the next 2–3 days.\n",

    "In your area, an initiative to promote frequent retesting for HIV among persons who face a high risk of HIV acquisition was implemented from October to December 2018. During this initiative, 1,482 persons were screened for study eligibility following community-based recruitment. Individuals who came for an evaluation were eligible for the study if they were aged 18 to 59 years, tested negative for HIV, and reported at least one of the following risk factors in the prior 12 months: (i) >1 partner; (ii) a known HIV–infected partner; (iii) a history of a sexually transmitted infection; or (iv) paid or received money or gifts in exchange for sex. We excluded participants who reported an intention to move away from the community for ≥4 of the 6 months following recruitment, were unwilling to retest for HIV in the future, or had tested for HIV ≥3 times in the past 12 months. In the context of the initiative, HIV–negative adults with self-reported risk were randomized to 1 of 3 strategies to promote HIV retesting: (1) no incentive; (2) cash incentives (US$7) for retesting at 3 and 6 months (total US$14); or (3) deposit contracts: participants could voluntarily deposit US$6 at baseline and at 3 months that would be returned with interest (total US$7) upon retesting at 3 and 6 months (total US$14) or lost if participants failed to retest. Measurement of retesting was conducted at the local government-run clinics where baseline enrollment occurred. This also means that during the initiative only clinic-based (rather than community-based) HIV retesting was offered.\n",
