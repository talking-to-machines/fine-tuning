The primary aim of this intervention was to take vaccine doses and nurses to administer vaccines to remote, rural communities. The initiative involved the following steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1. On the first day of the intervention, a social mobilization team—trained and supervised by the MoHS—organized a conversation with all village leaders, including the town chief, mammy queen, town elders, the youth leaders and religious leaders, and any other important stakeholders including the paramount and section chiefs if they were available. The mobilization team explained the purpose of the visit, answered questions about the available vaccines and asked leaders for their cooperation in encouraging eligible community members to take the COVID-19 vaccine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2. Social mobilizers then asked leaders to convene a community meeting that same evening (when people return home from farms) to allow mobilizers to talk directly with all village residents about vaccine efficacy and safety, the importance of getting vaccinated, and to address villagers’ questions and concerns. This process ended with social mobilizers explaining the location and timing of the mobile vaccination site that they were about to set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3. Vaccine doses, nurses to administer vaccines and MoHS staff who could register the vaccinated were brought into the community either the same evening or early the next morning. The vaccine doses and staff often travelled on motorbikes or on boats given the difficult terrain they had to traverse to reach these remote communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4. Once the team was in place, the temporary vaccination site started operating in a central location in the village. The vaccination site remained operational from sunrise to sunset over the next 2–3 days.\n",
